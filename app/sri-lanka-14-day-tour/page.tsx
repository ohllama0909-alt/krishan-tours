const tourFaqs = [
  {
    q: "Why is 14 days the ideal duration for a complete Sri Lanka holiday?",
    a: "A 14-day journey allows you to experience Sri Lanka without packing exhaustion. Unlike rapid 5-day sprints, a two-week itinerary includes 2-night stays at key hubs (Cultural Triangle, Kandy, Ella, and the coast). You get to climb rocks early, take leisurely train journeys, embark on multiple wildlife safaris, and spend several relaxed days enjoying the beach.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this 14-day tour suitable for families traveling with children?",
    a: "Yes, exceptionally so. Because drive times are broken up into manageable 2 to 3-hour stretches and there are rest afternoons built into the schedule, children don't get restless. We provide certified child safety seats, recommend family-friendly pool villas, and ensure flexible meal options throughout.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the itinerary change depending on the monsoon season?",
    a: "Sri Lanka is unique in having two opposing monsoon systems. From December to April, the south and west coasts (Galle, Mirissa, Bentota) are sunny and calm. From May to September, we easily shift the coastal days of this 14-day itinerary to the pristine east coast (Passikudah, Trincomalee, Nilaveli) where waters are crystal-clear.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the procedure for scenic train tickets?",
    a: "The Kandy-to-Ella scenic train is the most demanded train journey in Asia. As a licensed Panadura-based operator, Krishan Tours Sri Lanka secures reserved observation or 2nd-class seats for you well in advance. Your driver transports your heavy suitcases in the car so you can board unencumbered.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does the 14-day private tour cost?",
    a: "Our private driver-guide service for 14 full days is $840–$980 USD total for the entire car (1–3 passengers). Our complete boutique package, with 13 nights in handpicked 3-star to 4-star boutique hotels with daily breakfast, private vehicle, train tickets, and two private 4x4 wildlife safaris, starts from $1,390 USD per person based on double occupancy.",
