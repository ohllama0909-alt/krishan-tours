const tourFaqs = [
  {
    q: "Why is 10 days considered the ideal duration for Sri Lanka?",
    a: "A 10-day itinerary hits the sweet spot for first-time visitors. It provides sufficient time to experience all three of Sri Lanka's contrasting worlds—the ancient UNESCO Cultural Triangle, the mist-shrouded tea mountains, and the tropical wild south—without having to spend more than 2 to 3.5 hours on the road on any single day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which safari park should we choose: Yala or Udawalawe?",
    a: "Yala National Park is world-famous for having one of the highest leopard densities on the planet, plus sloth bears, crocodiles, and elephants. Udawalawe National Park guarantees sightings of vast elephant herds with virtually no crowds. We can easily recommend the ideal park based on the month of your visit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we extend our stay on the beach at the end of the tour?",
    a: "Yes! Many guests add 2 to 4 extra nights in Mirissa, Weligama, Tangalle, or Bentota for surfing, yoga, or relaxation. Your private driver can either stay with you for local beach hopping or return after dropping you off at your resort.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are the train tickets guaranteed?",
    a: "Yes. Sri Lanka Railways opens ticket reservations 30 days before travel, and they sell out in seconds. As a registered Panadura-based operator, Krishan Tours Sri Lanka secures reserved observation or 2nd-class seats for you well in advance.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does the 10-day private tour cost?",
    a: "Our private driver-guide service for 10 full days is $600–$700 USD total for the entire car (1–3 passengers). Our complete boutique package, including 9 nights of handpicked accommodations with daily breakfast, private vehicle, train tickets, and safari jeep, starts from $980 USD per person based on double occupancy.",
